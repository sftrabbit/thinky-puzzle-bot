Tapaban makes use of the number clues from Tapa, but lets you move them around the grid.\n If you get stuck, you can skip any level with the Konami code:\n ▲ ▲ ▼ ▼ ◀ ▶ ◀ ▶ X\n Content warning for Tapa fans: this game only uses the number clues from Tapa, not the connectivity or 2x2 rules.\n Made with Pattern:Script by ClementSparrow, a fork of increpare's PuzzleScript.\n Source code available on GitHub.",

Move in the forward or backward direction as normal. Pressing the direction of either of the two ends engages a turn pivoting around that end - this may take a bit to get used to. \nESC exits to the level select or menu.\nM is mute\n Vanilla PuzzleScript link: https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=dbe2d7356de6b37d759acb7379290189",

Contacting her friend and guide Elle, they set out to resolve things, but ended up with far more than they were expecting.\nSolve 33 puzzles, repair the magical wards of ruins of a distant past, discover some hints about what happened, and perhaps find more questions than answers in this playable demo of Addlemoth! The game is still under active development.\nPrimarily the spare-time work of mauve (@mauvecow) to teach himself how to draw pixel art, and also homage an old favorite game series DROD, it got a little out of control and became a full game in its own right. The positively wonderful music of HeavyViper (bandcamp) (@HeavyViper) adds much to the atmosphere, check his works out!\n Please give feedback here, to the above Twitter, or join our Discord to talk with us directly!\n Send inquiries to mauvecow at gmail dot com, or just DM on Twitter / Discord.",

It should be easier than Braid but harder than Monument Valley. You may get stuck on a level, but probably not for a long time.\n Gameplay and keys\nThat's not how you're supposed to do it!\n Your goal is to reach the blue doors to the right of each level.\n You can activate/deactivate a golden ring around you with the keys Enter/Space/X.\n When a golden object is in the ring, it will get \"Coyote time\":\ninstead of reacting immediately to the forces acting on it, the reaction will be delayed\n when a reaction is delayed, a counter is displayed on the object and it cannot react to other forces\n but you can still interact with the object (as you're the source of this power)\n Keys:\n arrow keys to move your avatar and select in menus\n X/Enter/Space to activate/deactivate the ring, close text screens and select from the menu\n R to restart a level\n Z to undo (can also undo a restart: press R to see the initial state of the level and then Z to get back to where you were)\n Escape to access the menu / pause the game\n Progression (last level reached) is saved automatically.\n Tools used\n Garage Band for the music.\n Everything else was done in Pattern:Script, a heavily modified fork of Increpare's PuzzleScript. Including:\n Sound effects generation with sfxr, and\n Project sharing through a GitHub gist.",

Each light when turned on or off will flip the states of the lights adjacent to it. Can you finish all 100 puzzles?\n Physical Edition Available to Pre-order through Bitmap Soft!\n Story\n It was a simple mission: Investigate an unidentified distress signal from a cruiser-class ship orbiting a barren planet in the Rigel system. Ikalo Pann, the Captain of the Star Leviathan, navigated through the debris surrounding the derelict ship until it was within scanner range. A scan of the ship pinged with no purchase for organics, life support systems were still functional, but losing power.\n With no signs of life coming from the vessel, they feared the worse but proceeded to dock with the airlock and climb aboard. Upon entering the main deck, they noticed the warped sound of a klaxon going off, echoing down the halls. Ikalo signaled to her crew to follow her further into the ship towards the living quarters. As they entered the next room, the warning alarm suddenly stopped and the doors behind them shut tight, followed by the grinding gears of a locking mechanism.\n The display on a monitor in the middle of the room came to life, a cursor pulsed rhythmically, illuminating the Captain's surroundings with a soft neon green glow. Suddenly, a pattern of lights animated on the monitor, and as they came to rest, a puzzle appeared over the on-screen grid. It was clear that this was all tied to the ship. They had fallen into a trap! There was only one hope - solve the puzzles to bypass the locks... and as the power continued to drain from what little remained of the backup power and life support systems, it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to their fate. \n Features:\n 100 Progressively Perplexing Curated Puzzles to solve in a 3x3 format\nRandom Mode - With over 500 possible puzzle combinations, you never know what you're going to get!\n A \"Par\" is set for each level to push you to find the quickest solution\nA Multitude of Color Palette Variants to Unlock - unlock through progress and by clearing Pars!\nSuper Game Boy support with custom SGB Border!\nSave Game (with Data Clear function)\n CONTROLS\nGAME BOY\nKEYBOARD\nMove Cursor\nD-Pad\nArrow Keys\nSwitch State of Light/Interact (In Menus)\nA\nZ\nGo Back (In Menus)\nB\nX\nAccess Pause Menu\nSTART\nENTER\nQuick Puzzle Reset \nSELECT\nSHIFT\n Story, Code, Level / Game Design: Bryan Taylor (Pearacidic)\nArt, Story, Dialog and Game Design by: Tom Lockwood (GumpyFunction)\nMusic by: Tronimal\nPlay Testers: Brandon Hudson, Ben Jelter, MHZ, and Joel J\nSpecial Thanks: Tronimal, Our Family and Friends, and Players like you!",

Safari on MacOS/iOS has default privacy settings that prevent the game from saving, so you'll have to use a different browser or change your privacy settings to allow third party site data to be stored.\n This game was made collaboratively by members of the Thinky Puzzle Games Discord server. The development process was in the format of an \"exquisite corpse\", where each person adds on a little bit (a level, a mechanic, and/or polish), and then passes it on. For the first time, all of the contributed puzzles have been compiled into a non-linear open world adventure with many secrets held within.

I had planned to implement Sorry! into this as well, but Sorry has about as many rules as all the rest of the games put together. Might come back to add it later, as I had some cool puzzles in mind with it, and it would make the number pieces more useful. Probably won't, though, since I think the next game I would make like this would be Proper Chess, which itself will probably be on the shelf for a few years until I'm better at programming architecture.\n V1.1 - December 6 2021 - Small update to make the earlier levels clearer thanks to my friends' feedback.",

      "title": "I Wanna Lockpick",
      "description": "I Wanna Lockpick tells the strange story of a girl's trip to an abstract world made of keys and doors. Or, well, I'd like it to, but really the keys and doors are the main focus here. It's a puzzle game! Assume the role of the reserved protagonist, Lily, and traverse many different abstract (and maybe beautiful?) landscapes, solving puzzles along the way. The main concept of the game is to bring colored keys to doors of the matching color, however new mechanics are introduced in each new world, with each getting progressively more unhinged and terrifying than the last.\n Pictured: Abstract, arguably beautiful. Note the lack of hinges.\n The first area starts out easy enough, but the overall difficulty ramps up pretty fast. There are many puzzles in the game (I could give a count but that'd be a spoiler), so trust me that you'll be spending a lot of time on it, and probably shouldn't try to beat it in one sitting. Also, puzzles CAN involve red herrings or alternate solutions, so try to be flexible with your approaches to each different puzzle. \n Pictured: A sad girl who can't open any more doors. My apologies, but get owned.\n You may notice there seem to be platforming elements in the game as well. For the most part they are just weird, and sometimes annoying. However, their role in the puzzles themselves is usually minimal, and any exceptions are intended to restrict or inform your options, and not to be execution challenges. Either way, there are QoL features such as undo (Wait, undoing in a platformer game?!?!) and mouseover details to hopefully make your solving experience more convenient. Unfortunately, there isn't a colorblind-accessible mode yet. I really would like to solve that eventually, it's just way harder to implement than you'd think (using a color filter really isn't going to solve anything)... If you have a problem with this game, please yell at me. I promise I will listen, even if I can't do anything about it. With that said, though: Please enjoy I Wanna Lockpick to the best of your ability!\n - PART 1 NOTICE -\n For the time being, this is actually only Part 1 of the game. That's because there is a critical point in the game which is far harder to work on than everything else which precedes it. So, as a compromise in case I end up never being able to truly finish the game, you have this playable version of the first \"main stretch\" of the game, minus some other cool and/or weird features planned for the full release. Don't be deterred, though; even though it's unfinished, I put a lot of time and effort into it, and I sincerely believe what currently exists can function as a game all on its own. If you make it to the end, you will probably think \"Yep, I get why the game had to be cut off here.\" If you don't make it there, then you got your full experience out of this game anyway. With that said, thanks for reading this far! Maybe you should play the game now.",

Most mechanics/puzzle sets are created and shared by game fans, and we collected them in this game. The game is also open-sourced on Github.\n The Witness (2016) is a logic puzzle game by Jonathan Blow et al. from Thekla, Inc. featuring line drawing puzzles on grids with various rules. \n Spoiler Warning: What The Witness? assumes that you have played the original game and understand well how original game mechanics work. You are not required to 100% complete the original game. It would be enough if you know how all the symbols work in the original game.\n In this collection, many fan puzzles were designed and created by various fans during the WitCup contest, a fan-organized competition on solving new The Witness puzzles under limited time. While the 4th and 5th WitCups are already programmed by Artless, other WitCup puzzles were only archived by images and we thought it would be good if we can revive them using a game engine. This is a major reason to start the project. We are also collecting more fans' levels on the way (if they are easy to implement).\n Puzzle set credits (see in-game credits for full detail):\n wc1: from the 1st WitCup (by Gentova)\nwc2: from the 2nd WitCup (by Gentova and Zhvsjia)\nwc3: from the 3rd WitCup (by Miaoji et al.)\nwc4: from the 4th WitCup (by Artless), see also https://artless.itch.io/meant-to-be-a-witness-clone\nwc5: from the 5th WitCup (by Artless and Alith), see also https://artless.itch.io/meant-to-be-a-witness-clone-2-not-witness\nwc6: from the 6th WitCup (by Zhvsjia)\nwc7: from the 7th WitCup (by Alith)\nwc10: from the 10th WitCup (A by Artless, B by Leaving Leaves, C by Zhvsjia, D by 牙刷架, E by 普通的解谜人, F by sevenkplus, & G by Fluittene)\nrpg: from the Witness RPG Mod (by Sigma144), see also https://github.com/sigma144/witness-randomizer\n Game editor: directly borrowed from https://github.com/instr3/WitnessVisualizer. Limited functionality and no documentation. Use under caution (game might break).\n Source code: now available at https://github.com/Alith-Game-Studio/WhatTheWitness.\n Notice of update V1.0 from any beta version: Some of your puzzle's solution lines will be misplaced after you update to V1.0. It is expected since we reimplemented the graph format. You can redo these puzzles to resolve this issue. Your progress is not influenced.",

But I'll try:\n Navigate your snake to leave the ground and break into individual blocks. Align at least four of the same color together in a group to pop them. Try to arrange chains of these groups so that when one pops, it causes another to form! \n Controls:\n Arrow keys or WASD to Move\n Z to Undo\n X to navigate back through menus\n ESC, Q or P to Pause\n Features:\n - 70 levels! (and counting)\n - Endless Arcade Mode. Assemble large chains with random snakes!\n About the name:\n \"Hebi\" (蛇「へび」) is \"snake\" in Japanese. It's doubled up in a similar fashion to \"Puyo Puyo\" (\"Dr. Robotnix's Mean Bean Machine\" was a western version of Puyo Puyo). The icon for the game is one of the snakes arranged like the hiragana character 「へ」.\n This game is in active development and open to feedback! \n Any levels have you stumped? Any seem too redundant?

The hardest puzzles are completely optional.\n No tricks required\n No feats of timing, quick reactions or dexterity are needed, just insight.\n Relax\n Messed up?

      "title": "Bringris",
      "description": "What's the goal?\n Just like in classic falling block games such as Tetris or Blockout, fill the levels -- once a whole level (30 cubes) is filled, it disappears. Try to fill as many levels as you can!\n How to move?\n wasd to move, space to drop by one level, Enter to drop (you can still move after this -- press Enter twice if you don't want to move anymore), hold Shift to display cubes missing from the levels below. Press 'p' to pause or see the main menu.\n Can I move the camera freely?\n While in pause/main menu, click \"explore\". You can then use mouse/arrows and PageUp/PageDown to freely explore the structure you have built. Do this, the views are AMAZING!\n How to rotate?\n There is no key to rotate, but since this game uses non-Euclidean geometry, there is no need! Just find a pentagon with five right angles and move along its edges.\n (If you change the geometry, a special key for rotation may be necessary -- 'q' and 'e' are used for this purpose.)\n How to rotate vertically?\n This game takes place in non-isotropic space -- the 'Z' coordinate works differently than the 'XY' plane (which has hyperbolic geometry). Intuitively, parallel lines in the XY plane diverge, while vertical lines 'stay parallel'. This means that vertical rotation makes no mathematical sense -- the distance between the points would change (when rotating around Y axis, points on the XY plane would become closer after the rotation, while points on the YZ plane would become more distant).\n (You can change the geometry to one where vertical rotation makes sense, but it is still not allowed for consistency.)\n But what if you tried to rotate it vertically?\n That's a good question! We do not know if anyone knows. It seems a good research question. It is likely that they would resist rotation, just like the springs in our world resist changing their shape.\n Why do cubes appear thin when viewed from a distance?\n In hyperbolic geometry, parallel lines diverge, so things become small with distance much faster than in Euclidean. Since our space is non-isotropic (hyperbolic in XY and Euclidean in YZ), this makes them thinner, but not shorter.\n Are the edges of the cubes straight lines?\n Yes -- more formally, they are geodesics. It is clear when the camera is positioned right above them. In other positions it may not look so because of non-isotropy (see the last answer).\n Why Bringris?\n The \"flat level\" is a manifold called Bring's surface or Bring's curve, related to the small stellated dodecahedron.\n Why is this particular geometry and topology used?\n In the full hyperbolic space, higher levels would have more cubes, which does not seem to be a good design for this kind of game. The original plan was to use spherical geometry for levels, but that does not give many choices -- only the five platonic solids; cube (six squares per level which become cubes in 3D) is too small, and icosahedron (20 triangular prisms) and dodecahedron (12 pentagonal prisms) are very non-intuitive to navigate. Squares with 72 degree angles are the best, and Bring's surface is probably the smallest highly symmetric surface that can be tessellated with them. With 60-degree angles there is another surface (12 squares -- like a cube where every face is doubled and you move to the other copy after crossing every edge), but these squares are larger, and you could not rotate-by-movement (with right-angled hexagons you could only rotate-by-movement by 180 degrees).\n How is the expert mode different?\n In the normal game mode there is no time limit. In the expert mode, you get less and less time for placing the pieces, and also you get score based on how fast you are.\n Bringris works with VR!\n Bringris works with SteamVR! (In the Windows version) The game is probably best controlled with the keyboard rather than the VR controllers, but it is quite cool to explore in VR. You need a powerful graphics card, or change the settings (e.g. disable raycasting and/or reduce the number of iterations or cells to draw ).\n What engine does it use?\n It is created using the HyperRogue engine aka RogueViz.\n What pieces are available, and what are their frequencies?\n Every piece constructed of 1 to 4 \"cubes\" is available. The frequency f is calculated as follows:\n start with 1\n multiply by the number of symmetries the piece has (identity, vertical, horizontal, vertical+horizontal)\n multiply by 2 for purely vertical pieces\n a single cube has frequency 1, not 8\n After a piece is chosen, its frequency is multiplied by 1/2^(1/f).\n What are the differences between the download and the web version?\n The downloadable version has better performance, basic sound effects, and the settings can be saved.\n More questions?\n Visit the Bringris channel in the HyperRogue Discord!\n History and Credits\n 1.1: introduces alternate geometries, and fixes some bugs (sound effects, score counting).\n 1.2: more alternate geometries, minor bugfixes, more settings to configure\n 1.2b: bugfixes (secret geometries work and are secret (press kl), fixed crash after bounded well)\n 1.3: added non-orientable hyperbolic manifolds and orbifolds\n 1.4: nicer \"pentagons\" geometry; an option to disable flashes; fixed disabling the raycaster; works with VR; nicer wall texture\n 1.6: the issue of Bringris crashing on startup on some operating system (unless the \"Vista compatibility mode\" was on) should be fixed. Also updated the engine, but this should not have significant effects in Bringris (except the controllers shown on the desktop screen in VR).\n For some reason, it appears that, for some people, the game runs better with \n Thanks to Ann, Berenth...ehm...Cathbald, Christopher King, Marek14, Sir Light LJIJ, and VƧ for suggestions!",
